            <p>Macy and Tori met in their sophomore year of high school and instantly hit it off. They quickly turned into BESTIES, hanging out basically everyday (sorry Pete and Leanne). They have been close ever since despite living thousands of miles apart. Macy went to Georgia for college and Tori went to California. Through that season they stayed close with facetime calls and visits during breaks. Now, Tori is attending nursing school in California and Macy is getting her PhD in Pennsylvania. They still keep up with hour-long facetime calls, bible studies and encouragement, and visits when they can. Tori is like a sister to Macy and we all joke Macy is an honorary Koch (tori's maiden name). </p>

God confirmed this when Macy, Stephanie, and Shannon (Steph's mentor) realized they are all exactly 10 years apart. Macy was able to surprise Stephanie with a baby onesie for her youngest daughter (Micah Joy) that said “Mommy, will you be in Ms. Macy's wedding?”. Stephanie was SO surprised and so excited to stand beside her! Stephanie is the sweetest soul and such a joy to have in our lives. </p>

            <p>Gracie is Sam and Eli's younger sister and Macy met her the same way she met the boys. While the boys were off at preschool Macy got to spend lots of time with sweet Gracie. To be completely honest, Macy fell in love with her HUGE chubby cheeks and bright orange hair. Macy has a soft spot for Gracies huge cheeky smile and bubbly demeanor. When Macy has free time you'll see her hanging out with Miss Gracie and her amazing momma Marta. Gracie is such a sweet, fun, and silly little girl! She has even won over Sam's heart! Like we said before the Roy family has become our family and we are so grateful to have them all be a part of our special day. </p>

            <p>Where do we even begin? Macy met Sam and Eli's mom Marta (now her BEST friend) through a facebook nanny page. Macy needed a summer job and Marta needed someone to help  out with watching the kiddos while she finished Nurse Practitioner school. This “job” became much more than a job. It became a family. Macy quickly became patr of the family and was able to spend every day of summer playing baby yoda, magnatiles, or “kitchen” with the boys. Although the summer went by WAY too quickly, Macy never left (LOL). Macy and Sam hang out with the Roy family often and have seriously made some new family members. Sam quickly coined the nickname little Sam and Macy's “Sam” earned the nickname Big Sam. Interestingly enough they also are TWINS. </p>
